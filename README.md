# Cyclic_Voltammetry_Capacity_Analysis
This code can take in CV .txt data [column 1= time (hrs); column 2= current (mA)], plot it, integrate under the curve, and output the capacity of each oxidation and reduction process

The premise of this work is to save me time going forward by investing some time now. In the field of electrochemistry, cyclic voltammetry (CV) is an electrochemical technqiue that experimentalists use to look at the current response of a system when sweeping the voltage within a specified range. In terms of battery materials, CVs are used to look at the potentials where redox (charge storage) occurs. CV is a powerful tool that can enable researchers like me, to study the kinetics of a material and better understand what is happening at the electrode and at what potential. One information we can also get from a CV curve is the capacity (typically reported in units of milliamp hour [mAh]), which tells us how much charge is being stored. If you look at the units of capacity: mA x h, it's current x time. The axes of a CV curve are typically shown as current (y-axis) and voltage (x-axis) but your instrument should also have the elapsed time data and thus can also be plotted as current vs time. By integrating (finding the area of) the region of each peak in a current [mA] vs time [hour] plot, we then have calculated the capacity [mAh].
